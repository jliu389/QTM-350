There’s absolutely no reason for my post not to be post because I have checked all the possibilities and I have 5G and a nice phone so there’s no reason for my post to be blocked besides the fact that they banned me and threw away the key and didn’t even tell me that they muted me. I also had an FIVE STAR online marketplace and convenient store but Facebook fully banned me from making an honest living. I made sure to give the best customer support and I even gave refunds. I was 100% willing to comply and change my posts but they banned me still! They do not deserve the business of Americans! They don’t have the right to take the Authority of Government in their own hands! I will not support a Social network that silences free speech and kicks out innocent users! There’s only one reason they should ever have the right to do this and it’s if American laws are broken! I wronged no one, I scammed no one and I stole from no one! I also never hacked anyone!
