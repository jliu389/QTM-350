0,I keep getting logged out of the Facebook app several times a day. Please update and fix this,0
1,Latest update is terrible.  Back button doesn‚Äôt work.  Not very stable,0
2,The latest update is full of glitches on the iPad app. The top bar on the top isn‚Äôt working. The back arrow on the left and drop downs on the right corner do not work at all.,0
3,With new iPad update version 14. Come on Facebook stay up to date already I don‚Äôt want to miss a minute of the election returns.,0
4,The latest update of FB has left me unable to get to my own wall or to make any changes in my profile or even to look at it.  The link to Messenger is not working nor is the back button at the top of the page.  I expected more of FB.,1
5,The back button is still not working until it is tapped about 15 times .  Tired of all your shutdowns and fact-checkers and Anti-Trump ways.,0
6,"I was recently banned for 7 days from Facebook for making a post that was not deemed to follow ‚ÄúFacebook standards‚Äù
The post was not offensive in the slightest.
Yet someone was allowed due to a certain political ideology to deem my post as not following the community (communist) standards. I was blown away at how much censorship Facebook is responsible for so close to the election. They are totally put of control and need to be put in check.

7,"Does anyone else have same issue, where the back arrow doesnt work properly.",0
8,The app is great I have a fun time using it but a problem I have is when I try to put multiple stories at the same time and when I put all of them some people can‚Äôt see some.I have to go to my story and press on it to see everything. This is fix that need to happen quickly.,0
9,Armenians who work in facebook restrict azerbaijani users for their ethnicity. It is act of nationalism and facebook team should do something to handle it,0
10,"not sure if this is a bug in the recent app up date, or in the ipad update, but the back arrow in the top left blue section on my facebook app has stopped working and never goes, even when I have not been into something.

Everything is good otherwise, and I use the app two or three times a day everyday.  Could you look into and correct if it is an issue with the app, or let us know if there is another cause",0
11,"On iPad the marketplace basically does not work, crashes regularly when scrolling categories, sort system not reliable and search is inaccurate and shows much fewer items than are available. 
Why can‚Äôt they also have a time limit as nobody wants to see items which have been listed months ago and the seller just didn‚Äôt bother to remove",0
12,"This social become very dangerous , all the data it‚Äôs spread everywhere... I cancel my account after ages. Happy to be without",1
13,New version has a bug so I can now no longer log in,0
14,"Giving this app only 3 stars because the back button on the top left corner of the app does not press no matter how many times I tap it. Thought I was having touchscreen issues, but that area of the screen works just fine when I use other apps",0
15,No freedom! I can‚Äôt practice my right and freedom to express my ideas. They always remove my comments and freeze my account. No freedom any more. Very controlling!,1

17,Silences third party voters.,0
18,As above. Doesn‚Äôt work so constantly coming in and out of app. You lose original search. Also the ads are unreal and a lot are fake or spam. Doesn‚Äôt update. Even after refresh I get shown stuff from 3 days ago despite it being at top of all others. Needs updated with ads in one area. Not all over my news feed!,0
19,"Dec 2019 - Please can you fix the app as it is not showing recent feeds when I select ‚Äúmost recent‚Äù. I can only see the most recent feeds amongst old feeds when I scroll through ‚Äúnews feeds‚Äù. 

As if the app wasn't annoying enough before when I had to keep re-selecting ""most recent"" to filter to what I want to see, now I don't have the option. I don't want to see posts from 27 hours ago mixed in with posts 10 seconds ago. Sort it out FB!!

August 2018 - now it‚Äôs even worse! Even if you select ‚Äúmost recent‚Äù you get posts from over 24 hours ago!
Come on Facebook, you are meant to be the benchmark for social networking, you should be improving with time, not declining!!

November 2020 - why do I have to hunt through a long list to get to the most recent button? This should be the default! And please stop keep changing the order of the large buttons too!",0
20,"If you leave the app for just a second, maybe to google something, then go back to the app to finish reading the article you were reading or finish watching the video you were half way through, the app refreshes itself without warning, you‚Äôre back at the top of your news feed which has now changed and you have no way of finding where you just were to continue where you left off. What makes it more frustrating is it doesn‚Äôt always do this which means the app is capable of remembering where you were, it just chooses not to.",0
21,Utter rubbish nothing works correctly and constantly bombarded with adverts for gambling and alcohol,1
22,Last update broke the app it intermittently says no internet while all my other apps including messenger work fine.,0
23,"In addition to the ‚Äúfriends except:‚Äù option, I would appreciate being able to make a post public with exceptions",1
24,"This latest update was around 10/26/2020 and in the 6 days since the release, my data usage from the app has increased significantly.",0
25,"The most recent version update last week on my iPad 6 and has a couple issues.

<   back button at top left refuses to work. Tap tap tap ....nothing.

Also an ongoing issue is when I get a notification for a post, I click on it and sometimes it takes me to the post....other times I have to use search bar to figure out who reacted or comment. 

When I go to settings menu it shrinks page. Like it thinks it is iPhone version not iPad version. Twitter has some replies to my post saying they have same issue,

PLEASE FIX THESE PRONTO!!!",0
26,Facebook has been caught red handed handing out info what does that make you feel about the app?,0
27,"A company that makes it money selling out America and spying on you.  

Not only should you never use this app or their site, you should contact your senator and demand they regulate this company out of existence.",1
28,Una app que va de mal en peor p√©sima,0

31,I‚Äôve been on Facebook for about a year now and I‚Äôve never had problems logging on. Recently I‚Äôve gotten a new phone and the app just takes me on a constant loop of uploading my ID and adding an email address. Once I provide that information the app informs me that it‚Äôs going to log me out. When I try to log in again I have to go through the same process of providing my ID and email. Jesus guys.,0
32,"I have my active status off but now with the ‚Äòrooms‚Äô feature everyone can see if you‚Äôre online so pointless - please remove this.
Also, when posting a pic I can‚Äôt access my albums anymore",0

35,"As of 02/11/20 the app keeps freezing on an Iphone 10 (latest update).

Whenever I try to react to a post the entire app freezes and forces me to restart the app which ruins the entire experince.",0
36,Since update the tool bar and back arrow does not function.  I have a iPad,0
37,It‚Äôs now required to select which option you would like your photos to be shared since the latest update. The update froze the ‚Äúphoto access‚Äù making it unable to select an option & post from my camera roll. üò°,1
38,This sounds like someone I know lol !! Ha,0
39,I randomly got logged out of my account and the only way to log back in is getting a code from a number I no longer have. I followed the link offered to get help and after filling out the form I says the link is broken or the page is missing. What is going on? I usually love Facebook but I‚Äôm very unhappy right now and there‚Äôs no customer support to contact.,0
40,"All the buttons (except the search box) at the top of the screen suddenly do not work. You can‚Äôt click < ‚ÄúBack‚Äù to go back. Can‚Äôt click on Messenger, nothing. Also, if you try to crop a photo before posting it, the posted version isn‚Äôt cropped!",1
41,Porque no me aparece la opci√≥n de Facebook parejas,0
42,"The last update leaves a ‚Äúback‚Äù arrow at the top left of the screen that will not work.  <  ...this is frustrating to say the least , especially when you are in a page and need to go back, the button just doesn‚Äôt work!",1
43,Title says it all.,0
44,"I have always been so pleased with the Facebook App, however, when my iPad operating system last updated, the app didn‚Äôt catch up.  I have deleted and reloaded the app numerous times.  I have checked every possible setting, but still bugs, bugs, bugs.  Several of the blue tab features at the top will only work when reloaded, but just for one opportunity.  I hope this can be remedied soon.  Thank you!",1
45,"I get ""kicked off"" arbitrarily when viewing pics.",0
46,Saved videos dont play past 10 seconds and wont scroll to the next one,0
47,So I posted something that goes against policy and got a 24 hour ban could not challenge it. And now it‚Äôs been 24 hours and I can‚Äôt log on at all. When I try logging on it says I have 24 hour ban  I hit continue button and get another message that I can‚Äôt log on and Facebook is working on the problem yet my wife can log on no problem What gives? Also tried to creat new account and can‚Äôt do that ether,0

57,This is app gets worse and worse each year. Yesterday I was ‚Äútemporarily blocked‚Äù for 24 hrs but was somehow kicked off of my page. The 24 hrs have passed and I have still not been allowed to even long into my page let alone being able to post anything. Everything I have from my son being born and so forth is on my Facebook and messenger and now I can‚Äôt access any of it. I hate Mark and Facebook as a whole.,0

61,Can‚Äôt go back once I click on a post.,0
62,"FB is a left leaning app that makes Trump supporters‚Äô lives miserable. They approve and allow porn and violence, while banning real truth. They replaced the Lifelog app which was a DARPA project, a spy program. I can‚Äôt wait till it goes away or gets taken over by good people.",0
63,"The latest updates to FB on my late generation iPad has the little left back arrow not working at all. Then today a person‚Äôs name I don‚Äôt know but she‚Äôs in a group I‚Äôm it, appeared next to the back button and has been there through reboots, etc. Whoa, this app needs some work!",0

Sort feed by most recent is now being hidden away in the see more setting and instead items like ‚Äúdating‚Äù and ‚Äújobs‚Äù are being prioritised in the menu screen. 

News feed is terrible showing posts from days ago.

The new page for Facebook groups is awful showing a mixture of all groups instead of being better like it was before and actually showing me a page with all of the groups I am in and letting me choose which one I want.

Honestly it is prime time for other social media sites to take advantage of this poorly  designed and out of touch platform that prioritises adverts and marketing over the user experience.",0

There‚Äôs absolutely no reason for my post not to be post because I have checked all the possibilities and I have 5G and a nice phone so there‚Äôs no reason for my post to be blocked besides the fact that they banned me and threw away the key and didn‚Äôt even tell me that they muted me. I also had an FIVE STAR online marketplace and convenient store but Facebook fully banned me from making an honest living. I made sure to give the best customer support and I even gave refunds. I was 100% willing to comply and change my posts but they banned me still! They do not deserve the business of Americans! They don‚Äôt have the right to take the Authority of Government in their own hands! I will not support a Social network that silences free speech and kicks out innocent users! There‚Äôs only one reason they should ever have the right to do this and it‚Äôs if American laws are broken! I wronged no one, I scammed no one and I stole from no one! I also never hacked anyone!
